silkscreen for L3 and C25 reversed! bad!!! -12V shorts to ground if you build it like this

all choke footprints are wrong

silkscreen for env A trim and env B trim are reversed, doh!

doesn't quite fit in the hammond box I had in mind (it could with a little creative filing though)

think hard about input voltage, 9V or 5V in?

not really a problem, but think about replacing teensy with bare chip in some future rev
